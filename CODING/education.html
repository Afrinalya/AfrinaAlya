	<h3><p style="background-color:plum;">I started kindergarten at the age of 6 in 2008. The school is located near my house in Taman Kota Cheras, Fasa 1. It was built in the area of the falt house to make it easier for parents to send their children there. As long as I was in kindergarten there, I had fun because there were many playmates who could be invited to play together. I managed to finish the kindergarten school session with flying colors.</h3></p style>

	<h3><p style="background-color:plum;">After kindergarten, I went to national school. I went to national school when I was 7 to 12 years old in 2009 until 2014. The school is Sekolah Kebangsaan Batu 9 which is located a little far from home. From grade one to grade three, the school session starts in the afternoon, while fourth grade through sixth grade starts the school session in the morning. I was also a school superintendent during third grade through sixth grade. During UPSR, I got results of 2A, 1B, 2C. After finishing national school. I applied to enter the coveted religious school.</h3></p style>

	<h3><p style="background-color:plum;">Just like the national school, I also got my education in a religious primary school when I was 7 to 12 years old in 2009 until 2014. The school was Sekolah Rendah Agama Batu 10. But, it was different from the national school, where grades one through grades three started school sessions in the morning, while grades four through six begin school sessions in the afternoon. In this religious school as well, I was the superintendent of the school from second grade to sixth grade. When I was in sixth grade, I took the PSRA exam which was only for students who entered religious schools. The result obtained is mumtaz. This is because, I prefer to memorize religipus subjects and all on my own effort.</h3></p style>

	<h3><p style="background-color:plum;">After finishing primary school, I am now moving to secondary school. I went to school from the age of 13 to 17 in 2015 until 2019. I have got a religious school near my house. The name of the school is Sekolah Agama Menengah Hulu Langat or better known as SAMTEN. In this school, it has only one school session and all levels srtarting from form one to form five will go to school in the morning session until the evening. The subjects taught also have religious subjects including sharia, usuluddin, and arabic. It interested me to continue studying and in PT3 in 2017, I got 7A results out of 11 subjects. During form four, I took a religious stream that included additional subjects, namely adab balaghah, manahij and accounting. After working hard for two years, during form five I got a results in SPM of 6A from 11 subjects. I am also very thankful for successfully finishing school with excellence despite the joys and sorrows.</h3></p style>
